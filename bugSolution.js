The solution involves ensuring that the layout of the `Camera` component remains stable during layout changes and animations. This can be achieved in several ways, including:

1. **Using `useLayoutEffect`:**  Wrap your layout logic that affects the `Camera` within `useLayoutEffect` hook instead of `useEffect`.  This ensures the layout is updated synchronously after the layout is computed, preventing rendering issues.
2. **Avoiding dynamic positioning:** If possible, avoid animating or dynamically adjusting the position of the `Camera` component.  Using fixed positioning or a stable layout container might solve the problem.
3. **Ensuring correct aspect ratio:** Make sure the aspect ratio of the container of the camera is correct.  The camera requires a specific aspect ratio to render properly. Consider using a fixed aspect ratio container to maintain consistency.
4. **Using `Camera.Constants.Aspect`:** Explicitly define the aspect ratio for your camera. This can help in resolving rendering inconsistencies.

Here's an example of how you can refactor the code to use `useLayoutEffect`:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

const App = () => {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null);
  const [type, setType] = useState(Camera.Constants.Type.back);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
    })();
  }, []);

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View />; // Placeholder while requesting permissions
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={type}>
        {/* Camera content */}
      </Camera>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```
