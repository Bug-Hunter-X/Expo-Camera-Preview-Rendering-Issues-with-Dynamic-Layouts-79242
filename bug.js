This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API in conjunction with other UI elements that modify the layout of the screen.  The symptoms are that the camera preview either does not appear, appears distorted, or is rendered at an incorrect position on the screen. This is often seen when using dynamic layouts or animations that update the size or position of the `Camera` component.
